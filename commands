Flags: -v->Enables verbose mode, showing the progress of the command, -x->Extact, -z->uses gzip, omit this if you just have a .tar, -f->specifies file input, rather than STDIN. Creating a tar file is just as easy, just replace the -x with a -c to â€œCreate".

//setting a hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <desired name>, use ".domain_name.com"

//editing the host file
sudo nano /etc/hosts

//telling bash to execute the script
bash <filename>

//executing the script
